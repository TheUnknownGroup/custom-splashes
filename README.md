## What does this resource pack change/add to the game?
This resource pack adds a splashes file which is able to be customized to the users' liking, or if they'd like, they can keep the default splashes that were added during the making of the resource pack. You can find how to change or customize the resource pack [here, which is the wiki](https://github.com/devonk15/custom-splashes/wiki).
## Where else can I find this resource pack?
You can find it on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/customizable-splashes)! In the future, this might be added to CurseForge...
